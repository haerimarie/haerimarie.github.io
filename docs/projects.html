	<h2>Summer 2020</h2>
	<p>Summer 2020 - the summer of quarantine. Though there were restrictions that prevented me from having the summer of my dreams, I made lemonade out of the lemons I was handed. I took Summer 2020 to build as a content creator: I worked with various organizations and grew my passion projects. It definitely was not my ideal summer, but it was a productive one nonetheless.</p>
	<h3>Addyk</h3>
	Addyk is an apparel company created by USC alumna Adrienne Kim. Though the company first started producing tie-dye clothing (which became a trend during Summer 2020 due to WFH loungewear), it eventually expanded into other forms of clothing. The branding of the company was unique - grocery store meets clothing - which was why I was drawn to the company. Thus, during my free time, I helped create graphics for the social media (@addyk.s on Instagram).

	<h3>Sparrows</h3>
	I was able to be a Marketing Intern for a venture-backed social media start-up called Sparrows during this summer. I spearheaded the team in charge of setting up a blog for the website (stories.sparrow.co). As the team lead, I helped a lot where I was needed on the Content Production team, which often meant making graphics to go alongside the blog posts or graphics for social media to bring more traffic onto the blog.

	<h3>Opportunime</h3>
	Opportunime is a non-profit organization that provides resources for underprivileged college students. The CEO of the organization needed help providing information and resources on Instagram in an aesthetically pleasing manner, so I created graphics to post on the Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter five times every week for the summer.

	<h3>Alpha Kappa Psi - Alpha Zeta</h3>
	For the Fall 2020 semester, I was the Vice President of Public Relations for Alpha Kappa Psi. As a part of my role, I helped improve upon the USC Alpha Kappa Psi website and created content to post on the Instagram (@azakpsi) for the summer. These graphics would often demonstrate how brilliant the brothers of Alpha Zeta were.

	<h2>Fall 2019</h2>
	<p>Fall 2019 was when I first began improving upon my design skills. Though I had experience here and there using Canva and had Photoshop downloaded onto my laptop, I really begun content creation because of Alpha Kappa Psi. However, the work I did for Alpha Kappa Psi mainly consisted of creating advertisement, flyers, and social media promotion posts. I started using the skills though for my class projects.</p>
	<h3>Marketing 450: Consumer Behavior</h3>
	For my first marketing course at USC, I was given a project in which I would have to apply marketing concepts to solve any sort of issue. This was very reminiscent of the design thinking process. As a proposed solution to the problem of "all-nighters," a behavior that many college students engage in, we created a new mobile application that would mix elements of Blackboard & PocketPoints.
