<h2><em>WHO</em> am I?</h2>
<img id="me1" src=../img/photo1.JPG alt="Haeri @ USC">
<p>Haeri Kim is a junior studying Communication, Marketing, and Applied Analytics at the University of Southern California. She is a passionate storyteller, something she recognized in herself from a young age. Regardless of the medium, whether it was television shows, movies, books, paintings, pictures, or fashion, she has always imagined or found a meaning and history behind each piece.</p>
<p>She hopes to translate this passion for storytelling into her professional career upon graduation. More specifically, she wants to tell stories for brands and/or decipher stories in data. In other words, she wants to work in advertising, marketing, or data analytics. She is also interested in various industries, particularly technology and fashion.</p>
<p>She is fluent in HTML and CSS. She has years of self-taught experience with  Procreate, Figma, and Adobe Suite (Illustrator, Photoshop, XD, Premiere, and Audition).</p>
<img id="me2" src=../img/photo2.JPG alt="Haeri in LA">
<p>Beyond her professional interests, she enjoys trying to improve her cooking repertoire. She has perfected three items: breakfast burritos, avocado toast, and ramen. It's been that way for a couple of years now, but those three dishes are so good she could live off of just that plus coffee (vanilla iced lattes with oat milk, always). She likes to read a range of genres of books and watch a range of genre of television shows and films. She also enjoys experimenting with make-up, playing with her adorable wiener-dog Donut, and journaling. She is a strong believer in retail therapy and spends an embarrassing amount of time curating her Pinterest boards.</p>

<h2><em>WHAT</em> is this page?</h2>
<p>This is Haeri's digital workspace and portfolio. Any and all projects she has worked on - both personal and professional - will be on this page. The page will mainly focus on Haeri's creativity and ability to storytell through various mediums.</p>

<h2><em>WHERE</em> am I?</h2>
<p>Haeri is located in the sunny and bright Southern California. More specifically, she spends the school year in Los Angeles & returns home to Irvine during summers. Haeri loves cities - the hustle and bustle appeals to her. She wants to continue living in a large metropolitan area for (at least) the next decade!</p>
